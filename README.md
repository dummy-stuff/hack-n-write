## Can I participate?
Yes you can. No matter your level in tech, there's always something you can do. You don't need to be a coder at all. If you are a UI designer, you can get us more designs. If you are good with writing, you can help us write more engaging content. If you are good with social media, we could use your influence to get the word out there.
